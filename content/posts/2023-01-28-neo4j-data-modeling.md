                                    <strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Avoid over-complicating your data model. A simple data model is easier to understand, maintain, and query.

                                    <strong>Keep your data model flexible</strong>: Avoid hard-coding specific queries into your data model. A flexible data model can adapt to different types of queries and use cases.

                                  In Neo4j, relationships are stored as separate nodes in the graph, which can lead to a lot of overhead when querying large amounts of data. Virtual relationships provide a way to represent relationships in Cypher without creating separate relationship nodes in the graph. This can improve query performance by reducing the number of nodes that need to be queried.
