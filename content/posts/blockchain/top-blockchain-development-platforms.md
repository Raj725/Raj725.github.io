Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we exchange information and value. It enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts that are secure, transparent, and immutable. As a result, developers around the world are using blockchain development platforms to build innovative solutions for a wide range of industries.

Blockchain developers are in high demand. Every day, thousands of people decide to enter the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. But how does one get started?

Like traditional software development, there are a lot of different platforms and tools that can be used to develop with blockchain technology. With so many blockchain development platforms being promoted these days, it can be hard to find the best ones.

Some of the top blockchain development platforms include Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Cardano, and Hyperledger Fabric. These platforms provide developers with the tools and infrastructure they need to build decentralized applications and smart contracts that can run on a blockchain network.

I have compiled a list of my personal favorites, that I use and trust.


## **Ethereum**

Ethereum, for example, is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. It is the most widely used platform for building dApps and has a vibrant developer community. EOS, on the other hand, is a decentralized operating system that provides a platform for dApps and smart contracts. It is designed to be scalable, fast, and flexible, and is popular for building decentralized applications that require high performance.

## **EOS**

EOS is a decentralized operating system that provides a platform for dApps and smart contracts. It is designed to be scalable, fast, and flexible, and is popular for building decentralized applications that require high performance.

## **Tron**

Tron is a decentralized platform that is focused on building a global digital content entertainment system using blockchain technology. It is popular for building decentralized applications in the entertainment industry. Cardano is a decentralized platform that is designed to be secure, scalable, and flexible. It is focused on building a next-generation smart contract platform that is based on scientific philosophy and research.

## **Cardano**

Cardano is a decentralized platform that is designed to be secure, scalable, and flexible. It is focused on building a next-generation smart contract platform that is based on scientific philosophy and research.

## **Hyperledger**

Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source platform for building enterprise-grade blockchain applications. It is designed to be modular and flexible, and is suitable for building private, permissioned blockchain networks.

## **Cosmos**

Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, known as “zones,” that can scale and interoperate with each other. It is designed to be fast, secure, and scalable, and is popular for building decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

## **Solana**

Solana is a decentralized platform that is designed to be fast, secure, and scalable. It uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and is optimized for building decentralized applications that require high throughput.

## **Tezos**

Tezos is a decentralized platform that is designed to be self-amending, meaning that it can upgrade itself without the need for hard forks. It is popular for building decentralized applications that require a high level of security and governance.

## **Chainlink**

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that allows smart contracts to securely access off-chain data and external APIs. It is popular for building decentralized applications that require real-world data or events.

## **Ripple**

Ripple is a decentralized platform that is focused on enabling fast, cheap, and secure cross-border payments using blockchain technology. It is popular for building decentralized applications in the financial services industry.

### **Conclusion**

These are just a few examples of the many blockchain development platforms that are available. Whether you are a developer looking to build the next generation of decentralized applications or an organization looking to leverage the power of blockchain technology, there is a platform that can meet your needs.
