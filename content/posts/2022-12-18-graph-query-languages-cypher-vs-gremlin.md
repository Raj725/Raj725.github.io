                                        When you start learning Graph databases you find there are multiple query languages. Some of them are standard and used by many of the top graph databases like Cypher, Gremlin, and SPARQL. Some of the graph query languages are specific to the databases like AQL(ArangoDB), and GSQL(TigerGraph).
                                      </p>
                                      
                                      <p>
                                        The most popular options are Cypher(Open source, Developed by Neo4j) and Gremlin (Graph query/traversal language developed by&nbsp;<strong>Apache TinkerPop</strong>).
                                      </p>

                                        Here in this post, we will see the differences between 2 of the most popular graph query languages: Cypher vs Gremlin.

                                        Cypher and Gremlin are both query languages that are used to interact with graph databases. However, they are designed with different goals in mind and have some key differences in terms of their syntax, features, and use cases.
                                      </p>
                                      
                                      <p>
                                        <strong>Cypher</strong> is a declarative query language that was developed by Neo4j, a popular open-source graph database management system. It is designed to be expressive, flexible, and easy to use, with a simple, human-readable syntax that allows users to express complex queries in a concise manner.
                                      </p>
                                      
                                      <p>
                                        <strong>Gremlin</strong>, on the other hand, is a more general-purpose graph traversal language that was developed by Apache TinkerPop, an open-source graph computing framework. It is designed to be expressive, flexible, and powerful, with a wide range of built-in functions and operators that allow users to perform a wide range of transformations on data.

                                        One key difference between Cypher and Gremlin is the way they handle graph traversals.
                                      </p>

                                        In Cypher, graph traversals are expressed using patterns and clauses, such as <code>&lt;strong>MATCH&lt;/strong></code> and <code>&lt;strong>WHERE&lt;/strong></code>, which specify the nodes and relationships that we want to retrieve or modify.
                                      </p>
                                      
                                      <p>
                                        In Gremlin, graph traversals are expressed using a series of steps that specify the paths we want to follow through the graph.
                                      </p>

                                        In Cypher, data manipulation is expressed using clauses such as <strong>CREATE</strong>, <strong>DELETE</strong>, and <strong>SET</strong>, which allow us to create, delete and modify nodes and relationships in the graph.
                                      </p>

                                        In Gremlin, data manipulation is expressed using a wide range of built-in functions and operators that allow us to transform data in various ways.

                                        Cypher has a simple, human-readable syntax that is based on clauses and patterns, while Gremlin has a more complex, code-like syntax that is based on a series of steps.

                                        Cypher has a built-in query optimizer that automatically chooses the most efficient execution plan for a query, based on the graph structure and the available indexes.

                                        Gremlin does not have a built-in query optimizer, so users need to manually choose the most efficient traversal strategy for their queries.

                                        Cypher is designed to handle complex queries with multiple clauses and patterns and can handle large volumes of data efficiently.
                                      </p>

                                        Gremlin is more geared towards simple traversals, and may not perform as well on complex queries or large datasets.

                                        Gremlin is primarily designed for property graphs, and may not have as many features or capabilities for other types of graphs.

                                        Cypher is generally considered to be easier to learn and use than Gremlin, due to its simpler syntax and more intuitive query structure.

                                        Cypher uses a declarative query structure, where users specify what they want to achieve, rather than how to achieve it.

                                        Gremlin uses an imperative query structure, where users specify the steps to be taken to achieve the desired result.

                                        Cypher uses a clause-based query structure, where different clauses are used to specify different aspects of the query. For example, the <code>MATCH</code> clause is used to specify the nodes and relationships to be matched, the <code>WHERE</code> clause is used to specify conditions, and the <code>RETURN</code> clause is used to specify the data to be returned.

                                        Gremlin uses a step-based query structure, where different steps are used to specify different actions to be taken. For example, the <code>g.V()</code> step is used to select all vertices in the graph, the <code>.outE()</code> step is used to select all outgoing edges, and the <code>.values()</code> step is used to return the values of a property.

                                        Cypher has built-in support for integrating with external data sources, such as CSV files and relational databases, using clauses such as <code>LOAD CSV</code> and <code>MATCH</code>.

                                        Gremlin does not have built-in support for data integration, and users will need to use additional libraries or tools to integrate with external data sources.
