                                                  <strong>Answer: </strong>Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ethereum came right after the evolution of Bitcoin and is one of the popular public platforms for building Blockchain-based applications.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                  Ethereum has become the most popular blockchain platform among developers as it allows building decentralized applications(dApps) and smart contracts.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                  Smart contracts on the Ethereum network are written in high-level developer-friendly programming languages like <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solidity</a> and <a href="https://vyper.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vyper</a>.

                                                  2. What are Ethereum smart contracts?
                                                </h2>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                  <strong>Answer: </strong>Smart contracts are the small programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are like software applications, and it&#8217;s used for digital agreements and deals.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                  Smart contracts are transparent and automated. They enforce rules and perform actions, agreed upon by their participants. Smart reduces the requirement of central authority as it offers a conflict-free solution as it can not be stopped or modified by anyone.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                  Smart contracts automate the negotiation and fulfillment of a contract. A smart contract runs on a blockchain network and can be used for a wide range of applications, including financial transactions, supply chain management, and voting systems.
                                                </p>

                                                  <strong>Answer: </strong>The Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) is the software platform that developers can use to create decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum. This virtual machine is where all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. The EVM handles smart contract deployment and execution.
                                                </p>

                                                  EVM operates in a sandboxed environment that is isolated from the external network. It is also Turing complete and utilizes Gas as an internal pricing mechanism.

                                                  A Solidity contract consists of a contract definition, state variables, and functions. The contract definition starts with the keyword &#8220;contract&#8221; followed by the name of the contract. State variables are used to store data on the blockchain, and functions are used to interact with the contract and modify its state. The basic structure of a Solidity contract is as follows:
                                                </p>

                                                <p>
                                                  Token standardization refers to the creation of common standards for the creation and management of tokens in Ethereum.

                                                  This standardization enables the interoperability of tokens and makes it easier for developers to create and deploy tokens with a common set of features and functionality.

                                                  20. Can you discuss the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) in Ethereum?

                                                  A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a type of organization that operates using smart contracts on a blockchain network.

                                                  DAOs are decentralized, meaning they operate without a central authority, and are governed by rules encoded as smart contracts. This allows for decentralized decision-making, increased transparency, and improved security.
