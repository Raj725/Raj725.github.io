<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>What is Cypher Query Language?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cypher Query Language</strong> is a declarative query language for interacting with graph databases, developed by Neo4j. It is used to create, modify, and query graph data stored in a Neo4j database.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher uses a simple, human-readable syntax that allows developers to express complex queries in a concise manner. It also provides a set of built-in functions and operators that can be used to manipulate and transform data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher is designed to be expressive and flexible, making it a powerful tool for working with graph data. It is widely used in a variety of applications, including social networking, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good thing about Cypher query language is that it’s very easy to learn and master. It’s very expressive and declarative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher’s syntax provides an easy way to find patterns of nodes and relationships in the graph.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is an example of a Cypher query that retrieves all nodes in a graph:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (n)
RETURN n</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Cypher, a graph is made up of nodes and relationships. Nodes represent entities or objects in the graph, and relationships connect nodes and represent the relationships between them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher uses the <code><strong>MATCH</strong></code> clause to specify patterns in the graph that we want to retrieve or modify. For example, the following query retrieves all nodes with the label ""<strong>Person</strong>"" that have a relationship with a node with the label ""<strong>Movie</strong>"":</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (p:Person)-[r]-&gt;(m:Movie)
RETURN p, r, m</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong><code>RETURN</code></strong> clause specifies which nodes and relationships we want to return as part of the query results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher also provides a variety of built-in functions and operators that can be used to manipulate and transform data. For example, the following query uses the <code><strong>TO_UPPER</strong></code> function to return the names of all nodes with the label ""<strong>Person</strong>"" in uppercase:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN TO_UPPER(p.name)</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher also supports creating and deleting nodes and relationships, as well as modifying the properties of nodes and relationships. For example, the following query creates a new node with the label ""Person"" and the property ""name"" set to ""Alice"":</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>CREATE (p:Person {name: &quot;Alice&quot;})
RETURN p</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Cypher is a powerful and flexible query language that makes it easy to work with graph data stored in a Neo4j database.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth noting that Cypher is not the only query language for interacting with graph databases. Some other popular graph query languages include <strong>Gremlin</strong> and <strong>SPARQL</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Usage of Cypher</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher is the primary query language for interacting with Neo4j, a popular graph database management system. Neo4j is a native graph database, meaning that it is specifically designed to store and query graph data. It is widely used in a variety of applications, including social networking, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher is not limited to the Neo4j database. In addition to Neo4j, some other databases also support Cypher as a query language. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher is an open-source project. You can find out more about the open Cypher&nbsp;projects on the&nbsp;<a href=""http://opencypher.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Open Cypher Website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many projects use the&nbsp;<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.opencypher.org/projects/"" target=""_blank"">Cypher query language</a>, some of those are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>AgensGraph</li><li>AnzoGraph</li><li>Memgraph</li><li>RedisGraph</li><li>SAP HANA Graph</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are just a few examples of databases that support Cypher. There are many others as well, and the list is constantly growing as more and more organizations adopt graph databases and Cypher for a variety of applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>What are some Common clauses and expressions used in Cypher</strong>?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher queries are composed of clauses and expressions, which are used to specify patterns in the graph, transform and manipulate data, and return results. Here are some examples of common clauses and expressions used in Cypher:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>MATCH: Specifies patterns in the graph that we want to retrieve or modify.</li><li>WHERE: Filters the results of a query based on certain conditions.</li><li>RETURN: Specifies which nodes and relationships we want to return as part of the query results.</li><li>CREATE: Creates new nodes and relationships in the graph.</li><li>DELETE: Deletes nodes and relationships from the graph.</li><li>SET: Modifies the properties of nodes and relationships.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher also provides a wide range of built-in functions and operators that can be used to manipulate and transform data. For example, we can use the <strong><code>TO_UPPER</code></strong> function to convert strings to uppercase, or the <strong><code>AVG</code></strong> function to calculate the average of a set of numbers.</p>

<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>How to Learn Cypher Query Language?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to learn anything is to start using it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would suggest you install any of the above graph databases. I prefer Neo4j because it’s very easy to start with. Neo4j also provides ready-to-use Neo4j sandboxes. There are plenty of resources like&nbsp;the<a href=""https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""> Neo4j Blog</a>, Youtube channels, and online courses to learn Neo4j.</p>

<h4>Have forgotten your Neo4j database password? Don’t worry, I am sharing two ways to reset or change your Neo4j graph database password. </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In some cases simply deleting the existing neo4j database or neo4j installation and installing it again may work. But it's not an option every time especially when the database already has some data in it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What are the default username and passwords of the Neo4j database?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have recently installed Neo4j and didn't set any password then your database might have the default username and password. You can try the following credentials:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Username:</strong> <em><code>neo4j</code></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Password:</strong> <code><em>neo4</em>j</code></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Method 2:&nbsp;Neo4j Server Installation (Zip/Tar)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, In some cases, we don't have an option to install the Neo4j desktop. We need to install it through a zip file(<strong>Windows</strong>) or a tar file(<strong>Linux/Mac</strong>). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neo4j stores its auth details in the <em><code>auth.ini</code></em> file. For obvious security reasons Neo4j stores authentication details in the encrypted format so it's not possible to recover the existing password from this file. The only option we have is to delete this auth file and set the new password when we access the Neo4j after a restart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""start"":2} -->
<ol start=""2""><li>First, stop the Neo4j database if it's running. Auth file is located inside&nbsp;<strong>“$NEO4J_HOME/data/dbms/”</strong>&nbsp;directory.

<p>The <strong>REMOVE</strong> clause is used to remove properties from nodes or relationships. It is also used to remove labels from the nodes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4>Remove Node properties </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 2 ways to remove the property from a node. You can either use a REMOVE clause or a SET clause. Using SET, You can set the property value as null and it will remove the property because Neo4j doesn't allow storing null properties. Storing null is equivalent to removing it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <code><strong>DELETE</strong></code> is used to delete nodes, relationships, or paths.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4>Delete Relationships </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We may need this query when you accidentally created incorrect relationships or you decided to change the data model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (:Product)-[c:HAS_CATEGORY]-&gt;(:Category)
DELETE c</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4>Delete Nodes</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please note that we can not delete a node without deleting the connected relationships. We should either delete all the relationships first or delete them along with the node or use DETACH DELETE on a node that will detach node from connected node and delete it. <strong>OPTIONAL MATCH</strong> clause is used to make sure that nodes without relationships are also deleted, without <strong>OPTIONAL MATCH</strong> nodes having no relationships will not match the pattern and will not be deleted. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (p:Product)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[r:HAS_CATEGORY]-&gt;(:Category)
DELETE p, r</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If there are no relationships to the node you can simply delete the node as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (p:Product)

<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you start learning Graph databases you find there are multiple query languages. Some of them are standard and used by many of the top graph databases like Cypher, Gremlin, and SPARQL. Some of the graph query languages are specific to the databases like AQL(ArangoDB), and GSQL(TigerGraph).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most popular options are Cypher(Open source, Developed by Neo4j) and Gremlin (Graph query/traversal language developed by&nbsp;<strong>Apache TinkerPop</strong>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here in this post, we will see the differences between 2 of the most popular graph query languages: Cypher vs Gremlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Cypher vs Gremlin</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher and Gremlin are both query languages that are used to interact with graph databases. However, they are designed with different goals in mind and have some key differences in terms of their syntax, features, and use cases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cypher</strong> is a declarative query language that was developed by Neo4j, a popular open-source graph database management system. It is designed to be expressive, flexible, and easy to use, with a simple, human-readable syntax that allows users to express complex queries in a concise manner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gremlin</strong>, on the other hand, is a more general-purpose graph traversal language that was developed by Apache TinkerPop, an open-source graph computing framework. It is designed to be expressive, flexible, and powerful, with a wide range of built-in functions and operators that allow users to perform a wide range of transformations on data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>The way they handle graph traversals</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One key difference between Cypher and Gremlin is the way they handle graph traversals. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Cypher, graph traversals are expressed using patterns and clauses, such as <code><strong>MATCH</strong></code> and <code><strong>WHERE</strong></code>, which specify the nodes and relationships that we want to retrieve or modify. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Gremlin, graph traversals are expressed using a series of steps that specify the paths we want to follow through the graph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>The way they handle data manipulation</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Cypher, data manipulation is expressed using clauses such as <strong>CREATE</strong>, <strong>DELETE</strong>, and <strong>SET</strong>, which allow us to create, delete and modify nodes and relationships in the graph. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Gremlin, data manipulation is expressed using a wide range of built-in functions and operators that allow us to transform data in various ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Syntax differences</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher has a simple, human-readable syntax that is based on clauses and patterns, while Gremlin has a more complex, code-like syntax that is based on a series of steps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Query optimization</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher has a built-in query optimizer that automatically chooses the most efficient execution plan for a query, based on the graph structure and the available indexes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin does not have a built-in query optimizer, so users need to manually choose the most efficient traversal strategy for their queries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Query complexity</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher is designed to handle complex queries with multiple clauses and patterns and can handle large volumes of data efficiently. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin is more geared towards simple traversals, and may not perform as well on complex queries or large datasets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Graph model support</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher supports a wide range of graph models, including property graphs, temporal graphs, and spatial graphs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin is primarily designed for property graphs, and may not have as many features or capabilities for other types of graphs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Programming</strong> l<strong>anguage support</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher is supported by a wide range of graph database management systems and programming languages and has official drivers and libraries available for many popular languages. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin is supported by a smaller number of systems and languages, and may not have as many drivers or libraries available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Ease of use</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher is generally considered to be easier to learn and use than Gremlin, due to its simpler syntax and more intuitive query structure. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin, on the other hand, has a more complex syntax and requires a deeper understanding of graph traversal concepts to use effectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Query structure</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher uses a declarative query structure, where users specify what they want to achieve, rather than how to achieve it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin uses an imperative query structure, where users specify the steps to be taken to achieve the desired result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher uses a clause-based query structure, where different clauses are used to specify different aspects of the query. For example, the <code>MATCH</code> clause is used to specify the nodes and relationships to be matched, the <code>WHERE</code> clause is used to specify conditions, and the <code>RETURN</code> clause is used to specify the data to be returned. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin uses a step-based query structure, where different steps are used to specify different actions to be taken. For example, the <code>g.V()</code> step is used to select all vertices in the graph, the <code>.outE()</code> step is used to select all outgoing edges, and the <code>.values()</code> step is used to return the values of a property.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Data integration</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher has built-in support for integrating with external data sources, such as CSV files and relational databases, using clauses such as <code>LOAD CSV</code> and <code>MATCH</code>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin does not have built-in support for data integration, and users will need to use additional libraries or tools to integrate with external data sources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Data manipulation</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher has a range of clauses for data manipulation, such as CREATE, DELETE, and SET, that allow users to create, delete, and modify nodes and relationships in the graph. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin has a range of built-in functions and operators for data manipulation, such as <code>addV()</code>, <code>addE()</code>, and <code>remove()</code>, that allow users to transform data in various ways</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Community and resources</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher has a larger and more established community of users and developers and has a wider range of resources and documentation available online. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin has a smaller and less established community, and may have fewer resources and documentation available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Language features</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cypher has a range of language features and capabilities, including support for variables, functions, and user-defined procedures, as well as built-in support for spatial and temporal data. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gremlin has a more limited set of language features, but has a wider range of built-in functions and operators for data transformation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both <a href=""http://64.23.162.152/neo4j/what-is-cypher-query-language/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Cypher</a> and <a href=""https://docs.janusgraph.org/getting-started/gremlin/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Gremlin</a> are powerful and flexible query languages that are widely used for working with graph data.

<p>While working with the data and databases oftentimes we have to deal with the Strings.  In this post, I will try to cover some of the most used Neo4j String functions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:uagb/table-of-contents {""block_id"":""0f86513c"",""classMigrate"":true} /-->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. Convert neo4j string to number</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This happens with everyone. We load the data into the database and then realize that we didn't mention the data type for the Integer or Float properties/fields. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the time we delete the database, fix the data type in the data load queries, and re-upload the whole data. This method works well for small datasets, but what if you have an extensive dataset, it takes a lot of time to load the data, or it's a Production database and you can't delete it. Unlike other schema-based databases, we can convert the Neo4j property types on the fly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will consider a <strong>Product</strong> node type for example. Let's assume there are only 3 properties: name, price, and quantity. The name is a String field, Price is a Float field and quantity is a number field, by mistake, we upload all the properties as strings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's create a product node with all the properties as String, and see how to convert price and quantity to numbers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""gfm"",""mime"":""text/x-gfm"",""disableCopy"":true,""theme"":""idea""} -->

<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>String to Integer</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can now use the <strong>toInteger</strong> function to convert the <strong>quantity</strong> property from String to Integer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""gfm"",""mime"":""text/x-gfm"",""readOnly"":false,""theme"":""idea""} -->

<h3>Running the update query in batches</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The above query updates all the nodes in a single transaction. You may get a low heap memory error if your database is huge. You can convert the above query into auto-committing transactions of smaller sizes. Following query run in transactions of 10000 rows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""gfm"",""mime"":""text/x-gfm"",""readOnly"":false,""theme"":""idea""} -->

} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 10000 ROWS;</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>String to Float</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can now use the <strong>toFloat</strong> function to convert the <strong>price</strong> property from String to Float.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""gfm"",""mime"":""text/x-gfm"",""readOnly"":false,""theme"":""idea""} -->

<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. Convert neo4j string to date</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's limited support in Cypher for converting string to date. Cypher only supports yyyy-MM-dd format strings e.g. 2022-06-30. You can use the date() function to convert dates in <strong>yyyy-MM-dd</strong> format to the date type.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""gfm"",""mime"":""text/x-gfm"",""readOnly"":false,""theme"":""idea""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (e:Event)
SET e.date = date(e.date);</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4><strong>What if your date is not in the  yyyy-MM-dd format?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's assume your date is in dd-MM-yyyy format e.g. 30-06-2022. You can split the string into a day, month, and year components and use <strong>date()</strong> function to create a date as shown in the following Cypher snippet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""gfm"",""mime"":""text/x-gfm"",""readOnly"":false,""theme"":""idea""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (e:Event)
WITH e, [date_component in split(e.date, &quot;-&quot;) | toInteger(date_component)] AS date_components
SET e.date = date({day: date_components[0], month: date_components[1], year: date_components[2]})</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alternatively, you can use the simpler function from the APOC library&nbsp;apoc.date.parse. This function allows parsing almost all the formats of dates such as&nbsp;a long date format  ""30 June 2022"". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""gfm"",""mime"":""text/x-gfm"",""readOnly"":false,""theme"":""idea""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (e:Event)
WITH e, apoc.date.parse(e.date, &quot;ms&quot;, &quot;dd MMMMM yyyy&quot;) AS ms
SET e.date = date(datetime({epochmillis: ms}))</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Convert the neo4j string to a list</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's assume you have a Car node in the database and you created the <strong>""colors""</strong> property as a string but it needs to be a list. You can contact the existing colors property and an <strong>empty list ([])</strong> to convert it to a list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""gfm"",""mime"":""text/x-gfm"",""readOnly"":false,""theme"":""idea""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>MATCH (c:Car)
SET c.colors = c.colors + [];</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have delimiter-separated values you can use the split() function to convert them to a list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""gfm"",""mime"":""text/x-gfm"",""readOnly"":false,""theme"":""idea""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>RETURN split(&quot;black,white&quot;, &quot;,&quot;) as colors</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. Convert other data types to neo4j string</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can use the <strong>toString()</strong> function to convert any other data type to String. This can be used for any data type like an integer, float, boolean, string, point, duration, date, time, localtime, localdatetime, or datetime value to a string.</p>

<h3 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Here are some common Neo4j Interview Questions: </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""align"":""center"",""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>1. What is a graph database?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A graph database is a database management system that is designed to store, retrieve, and manage data that is represented as a graph. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a graph database, data is stored as nodes (vertices) and relationships (edges) that connect the nodes. Graph databases are well-suited for storing complex and interconnected data and for querying data in a flexible and efficient manner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size"">2. <strong>What is a node in Neo4j?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Neo4j, a node is a fundamental data unit that represents an entity in the graph. It can store any number of key-value pairs, called properties, that describe the entity and its characteristics. A node is connected to other nodes in the graph through relationships, which represent the connections or relationships between the entities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, in a social network, a node might represent a person and have properties such as ""name,"" ""age,"" and ""location."" The node might also be connected to other nodes that represent the person's friends, family, or coworkers, through relationships that represent the nature of the connection (e.g., ""friend,"" ""parent,"" or ""colleague"").</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nodes are an important part of Neo4j and are used to model and represent the data in a graph database. They allow you to create a flexible and expressive model of your data and make it easy to query and manipulate the data using the Cypher query language.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size"">3. <strong>What is a relationship in Neo4j?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Neo4j, a relationship is a data unit that represents a connection or relationship between two nodes in the graph. Relationships are directed, which means that they have a start node and an end node, and they always have a specific type that describes the nature of the relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, in a social network, a relationship might connect two nodes that represent people, with a type of ""friend."" The relationship would have a start node that represents the person initiating the friendship and an end node that represents the person accepting the friendship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Relationships are an important part of Neo4j and are used to model and represent the connections and relationships between entities in the graph. They allow you to capture the structure and context of your data and make it easy to query and manipulate the data using the Cypher query language. Relationships can also have properties, which are key-value pairs that describe the relationship in more detail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size"">4. <strong>How to create a node in Neo4j?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To create a node in Neo4j, you can use the <code><strong>CREATE</strong></code> clause in the Cypher query language. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The basic syntax for creating a node is:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>CREATE (node:Label {properties})</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, <code>node</code> is a placeholder for the node you want to create, <code><strong>Label</strong></code> is the label you want to assign to the node (optional), and <code>properties</code> are the key-value pairs you want to assign to the node as properties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, to create a node that represents a person with the properties ""name"" and ""age,"" you could use the following query:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 25})</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This would create a node with the label ""Person"" and the properties ""name"" and ""age."" You can then use this node in subsequent queries to connect it to other nodes or to perform operations on it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's also possible to create multiple nodes in a single query by separating them with a comma, like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>CREATE (p1:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 25}), (p2:Person {name: 'Bob', age: 30})
</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This would create two nodes with the label ""Person"" and the specified properties.</p>

<h2 class=""has-medium-font-size"">5. <strong>How to create a relationship in Neo4j?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To create a relationship in Neo4j, you can use the <code>CREATE</code> clause in the Cypher query language. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The basic syntax for creating a relationship is:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>CREATE (startNode)-[relationship:REL_TYPE]-&gt;(endNode)</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, <code>startNode</code> is the node at the start of the relationship, <code>relationship</code> is a placeholder for the relationship you want to create, <code>REL_TYPE</code> is the type of relationship, and <code>endNode</code> is the node at the end of the relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, to create a relationship that represents a friendship between two people, you could use the following query:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>CREATE (p1:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:FRIEND]-&gt;(p2:Person {name: 'Bob'})</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This would create a relationship of type ""FRIEND"" between the two nodes <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, with <code>p1</code> as the start node and <code>p2</code> as the end node.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's also possible to create multiple relationships in a single query by separating them with a comma, like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>CREATE (p1:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:FRIEND]-&gt;(p2:Person {name: 'Bob'}), (p1)-[:FOLLOWS]-&gt;(p3:Person {name: 'Charlie'})</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This would create two relationships: one of type ""FRIEND"" between <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, and one of type ""FOLLOWS"" between <code>p1</code> and <code>p3</code>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also specify properties for the relationship by adding a <code>{properties}</code> map after the relationship type, like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block {""mode"":""sql"",""mime"":""text/x-mysql""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block""><pre>CREATE (p1:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[r:FRIEND {since: '2022-01-01'}]-&gt;(p2:Person {name: 'Bob'})</pre></div>
<!-- /wp:codemirror-blocks/code-block -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This would create a relationship of type ""FRIEND"" between <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, with the property ""since"" set to the value ""2022-01-01"".</p>

<h2 id=""understanding-nodes-relationships-and-properties"">Understanding Nodes, Relationships, and Properties</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Nodes</strong>: Nodes are the core building blocks of a Neo4j data model. They represent entities in your data, such as people, products, or events. Each node has a unique identifier called a node id, which can be used to reference the node in Cypher queries.</li><li><strong>Relationships</strong>: Relationships connect nodes together and represent the connections between entities in your data. Relationships have a direction, and a type and they can also have properties.</li><li><strong>Properties</strong>: Properties are key-value pairs that are associated with nodes and relationships. They provide additional information about the entities in your data. Properties have a name and a value, and the value can be of different types like numbers, strings, or booleans.</li></ul>

<h2 id=""tips-for-designing-efficient-data-models"">Tips for Designing Efficient Data Models</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Avoid over-complicating your data model. A simple data model is easier to understand, maintain, and query.</li><li><strong>Think about the queries you'll be running:</strong> Your data model should be optimized for the types of queries you'll be running against it. Identify the most common queries and design your data model accordingly.</li><li><strong>Be mindful of data relationships:</strong> Be aware of the relationships between your data, and design your data model to reflect those relationships. Use relationships to represent the connections between nodes, instead of using properties.</li><li><strong>Use indexing and constraints:</strong> Indexing and constraints can help to optimize your data model and improve query performance.</li></ul>

<h3 id=""implementing-virtual-relationships-to-improve-query-performance"">Implementing Virtual Relationships to Improve Query Performance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Neo4j, relationships are stored as separate nodes in the graph, which can lead to a lot of overhead when querying large amounts of data. Virtual relationships provide a way to represent relationships in Cypher without creating separate relationship nodes in the graph. This can improve query performance by reducing the number of nodes that need to be queried.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">What are Graph Databases?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Graph databases are a type of NoSQL database that use graph structures to store data. They are highly flexible and can store a variety of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. The key advantage of graph databases over traditional relational databases is their ability to handle highly interconnected data efficiently. This is especially useful in scenarios where data relationships are complex and require deep analysis to discover insights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, let's say you are analyzing a social network. In a traditional relational database, you would have to create multiple tables to store information about users, their friends, their posts, and their likes. This can quickly become complex and difficult to manage. However, with a graph database, you can store all of this information in a single graph, with nodes representing users, posts, and likes, and edges representing relationships between them. This makes it much easier to analyze the data and uncover insights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Benefits of Graph Databases</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

Unlike relational databases, where complex queries can take a long time to execute, graph databases can process complex queries in real-time, making it possible to discover insights and trends that would be difficult or impossible to uncover with traditional databases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another benefit of graph databases is their ability to handle unstructured data. While relational databases are optimized for handling structured data, such as tables with rows and columns, graph databases can store data in a more flexible and adaptable way. This makes graph databases ideal for scenarios where the data is constantly changing or evolving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Graph databases are also highly scalable, making them an ideal solution for managing big data. As data volumes grow, graph databases can easily add more nodes and edges to the graph, without sacrificing performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Graph Databases vs. Relational Databases</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While relational databases have been the standard for managing data for decades, there are some key differences between graph databases and relational databases that make them better suited for certain scenarios.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Relational databases are optimized for handling structured data and can be challenging to use for unstructured or semi-structured data. In contrast, graph databases can handle a wide range of data types, including unstructured data. Additionally, graph databases are better suited for handling highly interconnected data, making them ideal for use cases such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, let's say you are analyzing a recommendation engine. In a traditional relational database, you would have to create multiple tables to store information about users, their preferences, and their past purchases. This can quickly become complex and difficult to manage. However, with a graph database, you can store all of this information in a single graph, with nodes representing users, products, and preferences, and edges representing relationships between them. This makes it much easier to analyze the data and make personalized recommendations to users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neo4j supports properties and labels, which can be used to organize and filter data. Properties are key-value pairs that can be attached to nodes and relationships, while labels are used to group nodes and relationships together. For example, you could have a label called ""User"" that groups together nodes that represent users.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Designing a Graph Data Model</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Designing a graph data model is an iterative process that involves identifying the entities and relationships in your data and organizing them into a logical structure. This can involve creating multiple node and relationship types, each with their own set of properties and labels. Once you have designed your data model, you can start loading data into Neo4j and querying it using the powerful Cypher query language.</p>
